TSL-GameEngine (or TSL-GE, or TheSevenLives-GameEngine) is the python game engine, using
[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about), developed for the video game
[The Seven Lives](https://github.com/TheSevenLives/TheSevenLives). It allow you to make a python game easier by
predefining usefull classes and functions, such as an entire camera system or an enchanced command line parser. _(A more
detailed description will come sooner)_

So, this repository contains game engine as a python package, and some ressources to help you test this package and see if
you want to use it for your own game.
